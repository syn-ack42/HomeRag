                    <p>This video provides a step-by-step guide on how to manually create and manage trips in Cadis, including assigning shipments, using map-based drag-and-drop dispatching, and optimizing stop sequences. It demonstrates how to filter unassigned shipments, create a trip, and prepare it for execution, all within a few clicks.</p><a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="embed" data-layout="center" data-original-height="480.00" data-original-width="853.34" data-width="100.00" href="https://youtu.be/jzSgPIW0Ozc" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/jzSgPIW0Ozc</a><h1 id="Video:Howtocreateatrip,assignshipments,optimizethetour-Transcript">Transcript</h1><p>Welcome! In this video, we'll show you how to manually create a trip in cadis, assign shipments, and optimize the tour afterwards.</p><p>Open the “Trips” screen via the menu bar – it’s the icon with the truck and the green arrow. Here, you have access to all tour-related functions: creating, dispatching, and monitoring ongoing trips. Tours selected in the top left of the trip list – like the three in our example – will be displayed on the right in the map, each in a different color. In the lower left section, you'll see the stop list of scheduled or active tours.</p><p>How to filter unassigned shipments? Easy, switch to the “To be dispatched” tab. This list shows all shipments and pickups that still need to be assigned.</p><p>And now, let’s create a new trip. Click the “New” button below the map to create a new trip. In the following screen, choose a suitable local transport route.💡 Fields marked in light yellow are mandatory. Optionally, you can already enter vehicle information. Click “Save” in the bottom right corner to create the trip.</p><p>Since no shipments have been assigned yet, the stop list currently only contains the depot. Every trip starts and ends here.</p><p>Back to unassigned shipments. Switch again to the “To be dispatched” tab. Click the small downward arrow to open the filter options. Filter by:</p><ul><li><p>Execution date</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Transport type “Last Mile”</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Shipment type </p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Or the departure relation</p></li></ul><p>Save this filter as a view, so you can reuse it quickly when needed.</p><p>Now let’s take a look at the map options on the right. Here too, filters can be applied – for example according to filter selection from the shipment list on the left side. Shipments are marked with blue arrows down, collection stops have a red arrow up.</p><p>How to dispatch via drag &amp; drop? Let’s start dispatching – with various drag &amp; drop options.</p><p>From map to trip list, just like that. Click a stop on the map, drag it to your trip in the trip list. The stop appears in white once assigned.</p><p>Let’s create a trip from your shipment list. Drag a shipment from the bottom left list to your trip in the upper left section.</p><p>From map to trip in map. Or drag a stop from the map onto the tour directly in the map. This lets you assign new shipments, redispatch existing ones or add spontaneous pickups to active trips.</p><p>Now, let’s add one more pickup order to our new trip. Your trip now includes, for example, three delivery stops and one pickup stop. All dispatching actions can be easily cancelled during the planning phase. </p><p>Now, let’s move on to sequence optimization. Click “Optimize trip sequence” to automatically sort the stops in a logical order. The default departure time, e.g., 08:00 AM, comes from your system config and can be adjusted manually. Once you click “Apply”, the optimized sequence is saved, and your trip now includes planned arrival times.</p><p>Finally, release the loading so the driver or warehouse staff can start loading the vehicle. And just like that – your trip is ready to go! That’s it, a perfectly planned trip in just a few clicks. Thanks for watching.</p><p>If moving goods is what you do, Cadis software makes it smooth for you.</p>

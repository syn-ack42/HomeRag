                    <p>This tutorial walks you through creating and managing users in your newly set up depot in cadis, from logging into the correct organizational unit to assigning roles and permissions. It explains how to use the User Management interface, understand predefined roles like “Driver” and “LT Dispatcher,” and configure new user accounts — ensuring your depot is ready for collaborative operations.</p><a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="embed" data-layout="center" data-original-height="480.00" data-original-width="853.34" data-width="100.00" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7icwi2TcMd0" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7icwi2TcMd0</a><h1 id="Video:Howtoaddusers-Transcript">Transcript</h1><p>Hi there! Great to see you back. So, you’ve successfully created your shiny new depot. Congratulations! Now, let’s take the next step: adding users. Because even the best depot isn’t much fun if you’re the only one in it, right?</p><p>First things first: let’s make sure you’re working in the right place. Click on the account icon in the top-right corner. Now select Log out. Don’t worry, you’ll be back in a second. </p><p>On the login screen, choose your new depot from the list and log in again. Voilà – you’re in! Ready to invite your team.</p><p>Go to the tile called ‘User and Devices’ at the top, click ‘User Management.’ </p><p>Here’s what you’ll see: A list of users, including yourself. Plus a few CADIS service and IT folks. These global users are here in case you ever need support. So don’t worry – they’re like the helpful neighbors with a spare key.</p><p>Next, let’s talk roles – because in CADIS, everyone plays their part. Switch to the ‘Roles’ tab. Here you’ll find some pre-defined roles like:</p><ul><li><p>LT Dispatcher for Local Traffic coordination. </p></li><li><p>Driver for, well, your drivers.</p></li></ul><p>These roles come pre-loaded with the right permissions, so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel.</p><p>Let’s peek inside the ‘Driver’ role. You’ll notice lots of already assigned permissions with the prefix ‘mde’ – that stands for mobile device, by the way.</p><p>Each permission has a little tooltip explaining what it does. Yes, some of the names are a bit cryptic, but the tooltips usually save the day.</p><p>Pro tip: Want drivers to transfer jobs between vehicles on a tour? Just type ‘handover’ in the search bar. The system will suggest the right permissions. Tick the checkboxes, and you’re good to go!</p><p>And if you ever give too many permissions by accident? Just click the trash can icon to remove them. Easy.</p><p>Alright, let’s make it official and create a new user. Go to the tab User Management and click ‘Create’ and you’ll see this form pop up. The Login name is Required. Stick to letters and numbers. Set a temporary password. The checkbox ‘Password must be changed by user’ is already enabled – just leave it as it is. so only they know their final password.</p><p>Enter the user’s first and last name. Pick a role, like 'LT Dispatcher' and assign your depot. Normally set the Management Level to ‘None’ for regular users. For the curious ones: press F1 or go to Help in the Account Manager to learn more about management levels.</p><p>Hit Save – and that’s it. Your new user is ready to log in!</p><p>And that’s it! You now know how to create users in your new depot, assign roles, and manage their permissions. Great job!</p><p>Thanks for watching.</p><p>If moving goods is what you do, cadis software makes it smooth for you.</p>

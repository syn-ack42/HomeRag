I.e. you can search for e.g. “leon” and find “León”, “munchen” and find “München”, “weissmuller” and find “Weißmüller”. In addition, client side searches now match any substring, not just words that start with the search string.</p></li><li><p>“Priority” and “TOP” product shipments are now displayed in a consistent manner:<br/>A “crown” Icon displays a shipment with a product “isTopProduct = true” according to the master data<br/>An “arrow up” displays the priority value.

A trip created from a trip template takes over the defined alternative (vehicle resp. vehicle type), now even if a vehicle and vehicle type with the same ID exist, this was not possible in the previous version. </p></li><li><p>cadisSTUDIO: MyTrips and First&amp;Last Mile: Several bugfixes: A message explains why a shipment cannot be dispatched. The unexpected function to register “unknown” packages is now disabled in dispatching.</p></li><li><p>When you select several vehicles resp. trips in the vehicle resp. trip overview, and choose the function “message” to send a message to all these vehicles,  you now see the list of available and selected vehicles in the “Send message” dialogue, resolving an issue which occured in earlier versions.</p></li><li><p>Unprocessed collections (neither collected nor collection hindrance) will now be un-dispatched when trip is finished, resulting in previous problems now being resolved.</p></li><li><p>Training mode for registration type DRIVER is now possible.</p></li><li><p>Dissolving a masterpallet on a trip causes an automatic un-dispatch immediately.</p></li><li><p>In the order details you can print a preview. The formatting of the preview’s history has been improved, irrelevant overlays have been removed.</p></li><li><p>When you try to print an empty report “Delivery with signatures”, you get a message that there are no such deliveries to be printed.</p></li><li><p>The “approach” event for the next stop will now be exported even if the next stop is within the identical geofence. </p></li></ul><h2 id="R42024.2ReleaseNotes-TerminalHandling(TH)">Terminal Handling (TH)</h2><p>Many features listed here are available in all basic service cut levels (TH-SCN, TH-CSC, TH-PCS) but for some an additional license may be required while for others accessibility or utility may vary with the limitations of the service cut and your individual usage of cadis.

(The package remains listed as cancelled.)</p></li><li><p>Bug fixed: You won’t see unloading status for collections any longer. Instead, you see the unloading events for collections in the corresponding shipment.</p></li><li><p>Bug fixed: In the trip overview, column “capacity utilization” shows the proper values again.

Now such gaps are only visible if temperature values are unavailable for longer than 30 minutes. For shorter periods the values are interpolated in the curve.</p></li><li><p>A package listed below a sensor curve is now listed by its default barcode only. The latter is no longer preceded by the GlobalTrackingNumber of the shipment it belongs to: This information is redundant because the report is shipment specific anyway.</p></li><li><p>The report now also includes processes (loading and unloading) in which the package was handled without a resulting compartment change resp. temperature sensor change.</p></li><li><p>The report lists all processes done for a package. Specifically, for packages that were not scanned during unloading, the preceding loading scan is no longer missing in the report.</p></li></ul><h3 id="R42024.2ReleaseNotes-Temperaturecurveforcollections(retroactiveassignment)">Temperature curve for collections (retroactive assignment)</h3><p>When unloading collections documented on stop level, cadis now offers a feature for monitoring the first mile transport of collections <em>retroactively</em>, during unloading.<br/>In cadisAPP unloading, if configured, you are now asked to enter the vehicle compartment of the collection you are unloading. As a result, the temperature report visualizes the collection process from collection time until unloading time.</p><p>Terminal Handling, Unloading, LOCAL_TRAFFIC, section Temperature: “Loading unit thermo assignment required.” This configuration is for cadisAPP to have the user document the previously unknown vehicle compartment (i.e. scan the barcode on the vehicle compartment) for collected packages contained in the unloading list.</p><p>Please read the how-to page for more details: <a href="https://cadissoftware.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/kb/pages/1276739596/How+to+document+temperature+conditions+during+collection+retrospectively+when+unloading+the+packages?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiMDI2MWZjYjdhYWZmNGQ0YTk3NGNkZDVhN2I2ZDk5YTUiLCJwIjoiYyJ9" rel="nofollow"><u>How to document temperature conditions during collection retrospectively, when unloading the packages.</u></a></p><h3 id="R42024.2ReleaseNotes-OtherImprovementsandBugfixes.2">Other Improvements and Bugfixes</h3><ul><li><p>Improved data retrieval from provider Masternaut to avoid retrieval-related gaps in the EPOT’s temperature curves.</p></li><li><p>cadisAPP: The colour of the temperature banner indicates the temperature range: Blue for 2-8°C, Orange for 15-25°C.</p></li><li><p>If an unloading event for a temperature controlled package is cancelled thereafter by the terminal worker, the scanned package is assumed to remain in the vehicle.

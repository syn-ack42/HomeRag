                    <p>This video explains how to automatically dispatch shipments in Cadis using predefined rules, either from the trips screen or the shipment overview. It also covers the necessary setup steps like creating routes, trip templates, and dispatch rules to ensure efficient and seamless auto-dispatching.</p><a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="embed" data-layout="center" data-original-height="480.00" data-original-width="853.34" data-width="100.00" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG32oRwh8Do" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG32oRwh8Do</a><h1 id="Video:Howtoautomaticallydispatchshipments-Transcript">Transcript</h1><p>In this video we'll show you how to automatically dispatch shipments in Cadis.</p><p>With just one click all undispatched shipments can be preassigned to tours based on predefined rules. One way to trigger automated dispatching is through the trips screen.</p><p>To open the trips screen click the icon that shows a truck with a green arrow. Simply select the date you want to dispatch for.</p><p>Below the map on the right hand side you'll find the button Automated Dispatching. Click it. Now you'll see some filtering options. These limit which shipments are considered for dispatching. You can adjust or remove them as needed. Cadis will now automatically create the necessary tours and assign the open shipments to the suitable ones. You’ll find all newly created tours in the tour list at the top left. While you’re here you can also optimize their sequence to ensure successful planning.</p><p>Another way to trigger auto dispatching is from the shipment overview. Open it from the Cadis menu bar, that's the icon with the three brown parcels and select from the filter set “Dispatching Master Search”. Then filter for undispatched shipments and adjust your filter settings if you need it, for example by date or outbound relation.</p><p>Important: auto dispatching only works for shipments that already have a value in the planned trip column so make sure this field is filled before proceeding.</p><p>Select one or more shipments, right click, and choose Auto Dispatching from the context menu.</p><p>By the way you can also access the trips overview via the context menu option “related trips”. This is useful if you want to directly optimize the newly created tours.</p><p>Wait, is this magic? Well, almost. But of course there's some setup behind the scenes to make it all work. Here's what needs to be in place.</p><p>Now let’s create local traffic routes. Go to the Master Data section which is in Cadis Studio. Here you can set up all master data. First create your local traffic routes if you haven't already.</p><p>Set up trip templates (Regeltouren). Navigate to rules and templates, trip templates. In the trip templates section you can create new scheduled routes for both local and long distance traffic and even generate them directly from here.</p><p>Just click on the left hand tab called Last Mile. Click new to create a trip template. The route field is mandatory. It's enough to select the route and save but you can also predefine the vehicle and the weekdays the tour should run. Monday to Friday is preselected by default. You can also define whether the driver is allowed to dynamically load unplanned shipments or whether the loading list should be automatically released for loading.</p><p>If the tour is always handled by the same vehicle you can assign it here as well. Once done just save the template. Shipments can be preassigned to tours either in Cadis or via the host system. If your tours are based on postal code areas it's useful to set up zip code routing. These assignments can be created manually or transferred to Cadis via an interface.</p><p>Cadis lets you define detailed rules for dispatching. Go to rules and templates, rule definitions for dispatch. Here you can create rules based on shipment attributes and simulate their behavior.</p><p>In the rules engine you can define whether the auto dispatching option is set to true or false. If set to true, shipments will be dispatched automatically as soon as they are created in Cadis or transferred from the host system. No need to click the auto dispatching button at all, it just happens in the background. If set to false, you’ll need to manually trigger automated dispatching.</p><p>The rule engine allows you to test and adjust your settings easily. For example if you want the product code to take priority over other attributes, just drag that rule higher in the list and see how it affects the outcome. If your upstream system already knows which tour a shipment belongs to, this information can be passed to Cadis with the shipment data.</p><p>How Cadis decides where to dispatch a shipment: first, the rules engine checks for a matching rule. If no rule applies Cadis uses the tour data from the shipment itself. If that's also missing, the system falls back to the zip code routing.</p><p>That's how automatic dispatching works in Cadis. With the right setup it's fast, flexible, and a huge time saver. Thanks for watching.</p><p>If moving goods is what you do, Cadis software makes it smooth for you.</p>

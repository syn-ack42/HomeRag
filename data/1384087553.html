                    <p>This cadisSTUDIO tutorial shows how to set up mobile access for a vehicle, enabling drivers to log into cadisAPP and receive trip data. It walks through selecting the vehicle, choosing an authentication method, assigning the “Driver” role, generating QR login codes, and syncing the app—making your fleet road-ready with just a few steps.</p><a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="embed" data-layout="center" data-original-height="480.00" data-original-width="853.34" data-width="100.00" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l59E_Fl07c" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l59E_Fl07c</a><h1 id="Video:HowtosetupmobileaccessincadisSTUDIOforyourvehicles-Transcript">Transcript</h1><p>“Hey there! Ready to put your drivers on the map—literally? Today, we’ll set up a mobile access in cadisSTUDIO for your vehicles, so your drivers can hit the road with cadisAPP. Let’s get started!</p><p>First, head into cadisSTUDIO. Open the ‘Users &amp; Devices’ module, and click on the tab ‘Mobile accesses’ at the top. </p><p>Now hit that ‘Create’ button on the left. This is where the magic begins.</p><p>From the list of mobile access types, choose ‘Vehicle’. Let's leave the other ones for another day. </p><p>Now pick one of your vehicles from the dropdown. Heads-up: the vehicle must already exist in your Master Data. If it’s not there yet, go add it first. </p><p>Once selected, the access will link this vehicle to cadisAPP. That way, it’ll receive all the right trips.</p><p>Next step; Time to decide how your users will log in. There are three options: </p><ul><li><p>Code only – the easiest. Just scan the QR and tap ‘Log in’. No passwords. No hassle. </p></li><li><p>Password – requires you to set a password now, which the user enters after scanning. </p></li><li><p>User account – requires a full user login with ID and password.  </p></li></ul><p>For simplicity, we’ll go with Code only in this example.</p><p>Next, select a role.</p><p>Since this access is for a vehicle, and your driver will be using it, choose ‘Driver’ as the role. This gives access to pick-up and delivery features in cadisAPP—perfect for last mile heroes.</p><p>Hit ‘Generate’. You’ll see a shiny new QR code appear. This is your golden ticket. Print it, stick it in the truck, or tattoo it on the dashboard.</p><p>That’s it! The mobile access is ready.</p><p>Alternatively you can hit the &quot;Email&quot; button to send the Code via Email to your drivers smartphone.  Your Email program will open up with a pre-written email including a ready to click link that contains the code.</p><p>Let’s switch to the mobile device now. You can either go to the Google Play Store and search for &quot;cadis&quot; - or you can click one of those emailed links from the step before. </p><p>In any case, install it like you would any other Android app. And hey, if you're feeling generous, go ahead and leave us a rating and a review—it keeps the devs happy and the updates flowing!</p><p>If you have one of those barcodes, then proceed as follows:</p><p>Open cadisAPP. Use the camera to scan the QR code. Hit ‘Log in’. </p><p>If you have an email with a cadisAPP url, just click it again and you'll go straight to the login screen. Depending on your Android version it may ask you first if you want to open the link with cadis. You do. Now cadisAPP is synced with the right vehicle and ready to go.</p><p>Wrap-up and that’s it! You’ve just created a mobile access for a vehicle, configured authentication, assigned the right role, and logged in like a pro. </p><p>Now go forth and mobile-ize!</p><p>Thanks for watching!</p><p>If moving goods is what you do, Cadis software makes it smooth for you.</p><p> </p>

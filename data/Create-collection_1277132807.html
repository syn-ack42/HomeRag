</div><h1 id="Createcollection-Creation">Creation</h1><p>You reach the side for creating collections in the section Order Management / Collections / Button &quot;Create&quot; in cadisSTUDIO.</p><p>The fields marked with an asterisk are the mandatory for creating an unqualified collection order for which one or more shipments are to be collected without specifying the exact shipment quantity and recipient.</p><h1 id="Createcollection-ShipmentNumber">Shipment Number</h1><p>The shipment number is automatically generated by <em>cadis</em> when you save.</p><h1 id="Createcollection-Addresses">Addresses</h1><p>You can select the addresses from master data or enter them yourself.</p><p>The customer master data is used to select a consignor, while the shipper and recipient can be selected from the stop location master data.</p><p>If, for example, you select the collection address from the master data, all other collection related data, such as collection times, handling instructions and service times are transferred in addition to the actual address data.</p><p>Click on the  symbol to activate the master data search for selecting an address (only the field &quot;Name&quot; is active). Type in at least three characters and the matching master data entries are displayed. To confirm the entry, it has to be selected in the list.</p><p>If you have selected the address from the master data, the address is permanently linked to the master data. The address fields are grayed out and cannot be modified or amended.</p><p>You can use the  symbol to avtivate the manual entry or to remove the link to the master data to then modify the address fields. Once you have removed the link, collections can no longer be assigned to the originally selected customer or stop location in later changes.</p><h1 id="Createcollection-CollectionDate/CollectionTime">Collection Date/ Collection Time</h1><p>It is mandatory to enter a date, that is not in the past. You can also specify a date range for the collection.</p><p>The collection times are taken from the master data according to the day of the week.</p><h1 id="Createcollection-ShipmentQuantity">Shipment Quantity</h1><p>The entry of a weight is mandatory. If you enter individual shipment items with weights, the calculated total from the shipment items is displayed as &quot;Calculated weight&quot; in the shipment data. If no weight has been given for the shipment, the calculated weight is taken over as the total weight.</p><p>This logic also applies to the volume.</p><h1 id="Createcollection-AdditionalShipmentCharacteristics">Additional Shipment Characteristics</h1><p>There are additional shipment characteristics for the collection respectively the delivery. The three corresponding checkboxes and the respective explanation (tail lift, crane, additional staff) can be found unter the address data.</p><h1 id="Createcollection-ShipmentPositions">Shipment Positions</h1><p>You can enter more detailed information about the collection. A new position can be created with the button &quot;Create&quot;.</p><p>If all positions have the attribute &quot;stackable&quot;, the shipment gets the attribute &quot;stackable&quot;.</p><p>If at least one position has the attribute &quot;Dangerous goods&quot;, the shipment gets the attribute &quot;Dangerous goods&quot;.</p><p>In both cases – stackable and dangerous goods – the attribute can be overwritten manually in the shipment data.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-left-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource image-left" width="400" src="https://docs.cadis.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-65.png" data-image-src="https://docs.cadis.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-65.png" loading="lazy"></span><h1 id="Createcollection-HandlingInstructions">Handling Instructions</h1><p>You can enter a handling instruction with the button &quot;Create&quot;.</p><p>Select &quot;Collection” as the type if the text is to be displayed on the mobile device when you collect it. The &quot;Internal&quot; type is only displayed in cadisSTUDIO. Handling instructions with the type &quot;General&quot; are displayed for all activities.</p><h1 id="Createcollection-Dispatch">Dispatch</h1><p>After having enterred all relevant data you have the possibility to save and dispatch by one click, if the planned trip is already known and created in cadis.</p>

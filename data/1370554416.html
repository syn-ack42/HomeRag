                    <p>This video dives into advanced trip planning in Cadis, covering how to create and manage recurring trips, generate tours from templates, dispatch shipments manually or automatically, and handle geocoding and stop optimization. It guides you from setup to execution, ensuring you're ready to plan efficient, accurate trips every time.</p><a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="embed" data-layout="center" data-original-height="480.00" data-original-width="853.34" data-width="100.00" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9zEzx5de58" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9zEzx5de58</a><h1 id="Video:Howtomanageadvancedtripplanning-Transcript">Transcript</h1><p>Welcome to this Cadis tutorial on trip planning.</p><p>In Cadis, there are several ways to plan your shipments. If you haven’t yet, feel free to watch the other two tutorials: “Dispatching” and “Creating Trips” in the Trips screen, as well as the video on Automated Dispatching. This video? It builds on those and gives you even more. In this video, we’ll take a closer look at recurring trips: how to create them, how to generate trips from templates, and how to manually dispatch or unassign shipments. But we won’t stop there: we’ll also cover how to optimize the stop sequence, how to geocode shipments if data is missing, and how to bring everything together into a ready-to-go trip. By the end, you’ll know exactly how to go from planning to dispatch to that final green light. </p><p>It’s helpful to be able to create a trip quickly, when you need one. But let’s face it: most trips? They happen regularly. Every Monday and Thursday, or daily, and often with the same vehicle and driver. For that, Cadis lets you create recurring trip templates both for Last Mile and Line Haul. </p><p>You can access them from: the Trips screen (that’s the icon with the truck and green arrow), the Loading Views for Last Mile or Line Haul, or from Cadis Studio, under Rules and Templates, Trip Templates.</p><p>The template view looks the same for both transport types. So: Choose the area you want, say, Last Mile, and click the New button.</p><p>Only two fields are required: Route ID and Trip Name. To enter a Route ID, you’ll need master data, either Last Mile Routes or Line Haul Routes, depending on the trip type. </p><p>Can’t find the master data? No problem! Just press F1 and you’ll open the online help for detailed instructions. </p><p>Now define the days for the trip. Or leave it at Monday to Friday, which is the default. You can also decide whether: unknown shipments are allowed (that’s No EDI), dynamic loading is enabled (that means scanning undispatched shipments into a trip), and whether the loading list should be automatically released for loading. You can also define trip features: temperature control, customs, dangerous goods, long freight, and whether a tail lift is needed. If the trip usually uses the same vehicle, you can set it right here, as long as the vehicle exists in your master data. Now click Save and voilà your recurring trip template is ready. </p><p>You can now generate trips for up to 31 days in advance. Do this either: in Cadis Studio, from Trip Templates, or in Trips or the Loading Views, via the menu: Recurring Collections/Trips &gt; Create Recurring Trips.</p><p>But here's something important: If you’re using auto-dispatching, you don’t need to generate the trips yourself. The Rules Engine will do that for you ✨ However: It will only create trips for which there are planned shipments ready to be auto-dispatched. So: no planned shipments, no generated trip, simple as that. </p><p>Now let’s talk about dispatching. You can do it manually or let Cadis auto-dispatch. Refer to the other tutorials if you’re new to this. Here’s how to do it manually: Right-click a shipment in the overview and select Dispatch (Last Mile). The Dispatch Check appears. Now pick a trip from the lower table. Sometimes you’ll see warnings marked with an exclamation mark. </p><p>For example: You're assigning a shipment that needs a tail lift to a vehicle that doesn’t have one. You, as dispatcher, can override that using the Dispatch button. </p><p>But: Some checks can’t be overridden, like if loading or orders are already completed. </p><p>By the way: You can customize the shipment overview to your needs. Column order, filters, visibility. All of these can be saved as a personal or global view. You’ll find detailed instructions on how to do this in the Cadis Online Help. </p><p>Need to undo a dispatch? You can remove shipments: from the Trips screen (top left, right-click), here you would remove all assigned shipments of the selected tour or from the stop list to cancel selected stops or from the Loading List directly. </p><p>Want to optimize the stop order? Of course! You can do that: in the Trips screen (for multiple trips), or in the trip details (Loading View), which you access by double-clicking the trip or using the context menu Loading List. </p><p>If optimization doesn’t work Cadis will tell you. Usually, it’s due to missing geo-data. Check which shipment it is by displaying the “Geo Info” column. To geocode a shipment: Open its details, and click the crosshair in the top-left. In the geocoding screen, cadis offers smart location candidates based on the shipment’s address. You can either search for an address or simply click directly on the map to place a pin. Each time you click, a new pin appears, and that location is added to the list of possible matches just below. Found the right spot? Just click &quot;Apply&quot; and the address will be added to your shipment in no time. It’s intuitive, flexible, and especially helpful when a location needs a little manual fine-tuning. That’s it – geo-data added! If you have many shipments with missing geodata, use the filter “Not geocoded shipments today” to handle several at once. Once you’ve manually geocoded an address, cadis will remember it, like a little GPS memory. The next time a shipment with that same address shows up, cadis doesn’t ask again. It quietly pulls the saved location and gets it right from the start. </p><p>So, what feels like a small manual step today, saves you time in the future. And off your shipments go, without a detour. When everything’s geocoded, you can optimize all of your routes successfully. </p><p>If you get a red traffic light during optimization, maybe the stop’s time window might not be met. You can: choose to ignore time windows for that stop. This gives you a yellow or green light, and you can proceed with optimization. Or adjust the departure time from depot. But every now and then, the reason might be a bit more hidden. Some addresses have truck access restrictions, like weight limits, height clearances, or limited delivery times. </p><p>Some exceptions aren’t that easy to spot during optimization. If you run into a tricky one like this and nothing seems to help, no stress. You can always unassign the shipment and handle it separately. There’s always a way! </p><p>Final Steps: Loading and Go. Once the trip is ready, the dispatcher can release the loading. Drivers or warehouse staff can now start loading in the Cadis App. When all shipments are loaded and the driver has requested final approval, the loading of the trip can be closed. Now the driver receives the stop list on his device, and off he goes!</p><p>From this moment on, you can’t change or reassign shipments anymore, but spontaneous pickups can still be added while the trip is active. </p><p>And that’s it! You’re now ready to master trip planning in CADIS. Thanks for watching!</p><p>If moving goods is what you do, Cadis software makes it smooth for you.</p>

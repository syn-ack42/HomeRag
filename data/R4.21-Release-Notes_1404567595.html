In some cases, availability of information and/or functions in a feature may depend on service cut and other licensed options.</p><h4 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-Introducing“ChangeHistory”Documentation">Introducing “Change History” Documentation</h4><p>We believe that you can never have too much information about the software you use to run your business. That’s why we are committed to providing full transparency about all work done on our product. In addition to this regular Release Note, we now offer an always-updated online listing of all changes in cadis via our online help pages, starting with R4.19.</p><p>“All changes” truly means everything—from the latest and greatest feature to the most minor bug-fix. Just browse to “Product Info” =&gt; “Change History” to review the detailed change history for each release. Due to the length and constant updates, this list is only available in English.</p><p>Each cadis release change history has two main segments:</p><ol start="1"><li><p><strong>Main Release Segment:</strong> Titled with the release identifier (e.g., “R4.21”). This section contains all changes developed in that release, split into “New and Changed Functions” and “Bugfixes.” This section is not updated post-release, except for documentation errors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Maintenance Segment:</strong> This section includes a chapter for each maintenance release of the main release (e.g., “R4.21-LTS-1”). Whenever a new maintenance version is available, all changes in that version are documented here.</p></li></ol><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-left-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource image-left" alt="Change History" width="600" src="https://docs.cadis.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ChangeHistory.png" data-image-src="https://docs.cadis.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ChangeHistory.png" loading="lazy"></span><p>Each software change includes the following information:</p><ol start="1"><li><p><strong>A unique number (e.g., “[RD-809]”):</strong> If you reported a bug or requested a feature, you might have been given this number as our internal reference. It is also useful if you have any questions.</p></li><li><p><strong>A topic identifier:</strong> This labels the change with a general group of topics, providing context.</p></li><li><p><strong>A list of older cadis versions where this change has been merged:</strong> For example, “RD-1015” has been included in older releases, starting with “R4.19 LTS-8” and “R4.20 LTS.1” in their respective release trains. This change is also listed in the “Maintenance” section of those releases.</p></li></ol><p>Please note that the change history typically does not include information on required licenses. It also includes features that are still in alpha or beta stages. Thus, you might find references to features that you haven’t seen in cadis—they may not be included in your license or might be released only to selected alpha or beta testers.</p><p>We will continue distributing this Release Note Letter with every cadis release, where we delve deeper into the changes we believe will have the most impact on you. In this letter, we will describe how you can best utilize new cadis features and where you may need to watch for changes in behavior. However, if you want to understand what lies behind the label “bugfixes and performance improvements,” the change history is the place to find it.</p><p>Give it a try and check out the R4.21 change history here: <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.cadis.cloud/en/cadis-online-help/product-information/release-notes-intern/change-history-r4-21/" rel="nofollow"><u>R4.21 Change History</u></a></p><h4 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-AdvancedTableFeaturesincadisSTUDIO">Advanced Table Features in cadisSTUDIO</h4><p>We have updated the tables in cadisSTUDIO with many advanced features. See the following article for an overview of new table features:<br/><a class="external-link" href="https://docs.cadis.cloud/en/2024/08/12/how-to-use-the-advanced-table-features-in-cadisstudio/" rel="nofollow"><u>How to Use the Advanced Table Features in cadisSTUDIO</u></a></p><h4 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-DefaultRowHeightincadisSTUDIOTables">Default Row Height in cadisSTUDIO Tables</h4><p>Due to usability requests, the default row height has been set to “small.” If you preferred the previous default of “Medium,” you can change it via the table settings menu (“Gear” icon at the top right of every table).</p><h4 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-cadisSTUDIOTableFilters">cadisSTUDIO Table Filters</h4><p>The filtering system in CadisSTUDIO has been upgraded. See this article for information on how table filters in cadis work:<br/><a class="external-link" href="https://docs.cadis.cloud/en/2024/08/12/how-do-cadisstudio-table-filters-work/" rel="nofollow"><u>How do cadisSTUDIO Table Filters Work?</u></a></p><h4 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-PTV2Maps">PTV 2 Maps</h4><p>PTV 2 maps are now available in cadisSTUDIO and cadisCONTROL. OpenStreetMap, PTV 1 (not in cadisSTUDIO), and PTV 2 maps are now available and can be selected via configuration on depot level.</p><p><em>Note: PTV 2 can not be hosted on-premise . It is, however, available as a SaaS service for our on-premise customers.</em></p><h4 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-PTV2AuthenticationSupport">PTV 2 Authentication Support</h4><p>PTV 2 integration now supports authentication via HTTP basic authentication. With this security feature, we can now easily offer PTV 2 as a SaaS component to our on-premise customers.</p><h4 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-PTV2GeocodingQualityConfiguration">PTV 2 Geocoding Quality Configuration</h4><p>The minimum acceptable geocoding quality for automatically geocoded addresses (i.e., without user confirmation) can now be configured in greater detail for PTV (individual scores for city, street, and postcode match quality). See <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.cadis.cloud/en/2024/06/12/why-are-some-addresses-not-automatically-geocoded/" rel="nofollow"><u>Why are some addresses not (automatically) geocoded?</u></a> for background on how automatic geocoding works in cadis.</p><h4 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-OtherImprovementsandBugfixes">Other Improvements and Bugfixes</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Delivery Times in Rule Engine:</strong> Rule engines using “delivery time” in a condition did not respect local time. If you worked around this issue by adjusting the configuration in the rule engine, you may need to undo these adjustments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Upgrade to Wildfly 32.0.0.Final</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>cadisCONTROL is now bundled and runs with Java 21.0.3</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Various other minor improvements and bugfixes (see change history)</strong></p></li></ul><h3 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-PickUpandDelivery(PUD)">Pick Up and Delivery (PUD)</h3><p>If not stated otherwise new features are generally available in all basic service cut levels (PUD-DRV, PUD-LDR, PUD-PLD) but accessibility or utility may vary with the limitations of the service cut and your individual usage of cadis. In some cases, availability of information and/or functions in a feature may depend on service cut and other licensed options.</p><h4 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-StopSequenceOptimizationincadisSTUDIO">Stop Sequence Optimization in cadisSTUDIO</h4><p><em>License requirement: PUD-LDR and PUD-SSO</em></p><p>The stop sequence optimization is now available in cadisSTUDIO. Please see the following article on how to use it: <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.cadis.cloud/en/2024/05/17/how-to-optimize-sequence-cadisstudio/" rel="nofollow"><u>How to optimize sequence – cadisSTUDIO</u></a></p><h4 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-HandlingofTripProperties">Handling of Trip Properties</h4><p><em>License requirement: PUD-PLD, PUD-LDR</em></p><p>The handling of trip properties (e.g., long load, dangerous goods) for trip templates (cadisSTUDIO) and trips (cadisCONTROL) has been reworked and made consistent. For both traffic types—local traffic and line haul—all properties can now be changed at any time until loading is closed, even if a vehicle combination has been determined. If a vehicle or relation (for line hauls) is selected, the properties set in that master data record are applied, possibly overwriting previous manual changes.</p><p>We also fixed some minor bugs related to these properties, such as not applying all properties when selecting a vehicle type instead of an actual vehicle.</p><p>Notably, a bug-fix for imported loading lists (cTOutboundTransport) now correctly derives the max. allowed gross weight from vehicle master data during import. Previously, this was applied when a trip was modified in cadisCONTROL using the details screen. If you notice changes in behavior related to dispatching checks (i.e., warnings that didn’t appear before), you may want to check your vehicle type master data as these settings may now be applied correctly.</p><h4 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-ClassificationCodeinDangerousGoodsAttachment">Classification Code in Dangerous Goods Attachment</h4><p>We added a field for “Classification Code” in the dangerous goods print document, displayed only for substances in dangerous goods class 1. (This change has also been released in maintenance versions of older cadis releases.)</p><h4 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-NewIntegrationAPIforDocumentedStopsandOrderStates">New Integration API for Documented Stops and Order States</h4><p><em>License requirement: PUD-CON</em></p><p>We have added two new public API endpoints to request documented stops (optionally including the status of the contained orders) and order states without stop context.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Stop Level Information:</strong> Provided by the “documentedStops” endpoint, including actual GPS position, user identification, geo-fence timestamps, etc. This information only exists if the stop was documented by a mobile device; it does not exist if order status was set via the office user interface.</p></li><li><p><strong>Order Level Status Information:</strong> Provided by the “orderStates” endpoint, independent of documentation by a mobile device.</p></li></ul><h4 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-OtherNotableImprovementsandBugfixes">Other Notable Improvements and Bugfixes</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Removed unintended Handling Instruction types from runsheet print document.</strong> Only instructions of type “General” and “Delivery” will now be printed.</p></li><li><p><strong>cadisSTUDIO collection template:</strong> The “Template name” field is no longer mandatory to maintain backward compatibility with templates created in cadisCONTROL, where it was never mandatory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trips on disqualified (DSQ) local traffic outbound routes</strong> now remain in the ‘Loading closed’ state instead of ‘Ready for trip start.’</p></li><li><p><strong>Fix for cTTour Import:</strong> Fixed an issue where cTTour was not imported if the vehicle type was a semi-truck tractor (“TruckSemi”). If you want to pass semi-trucks via the cTTour interface, which does not have the capability of setting trailers, you must set a “default trailer” in the vehicle master data as a semi-tractor does not have any loading capacity. If the master data is set up accordingly, cadis will automatically add the selected default trailer to the trip.</p></li><li><p><strong>Proof of Delivery Report:</strong> Added configuration for geolocation and GEO-coordinates in the PDF.</p></li><li><p><strong>Proof of Delivery Report:</strong> Added configuration for Global Tracking Number and column on the document.</p></li><li><p><strong>The screen to add shipment via MyTrips now only provides dispatchable shipments.</strong> This avoids confusion where a shipment has one (or many) associated partial shipments, only one of which can ever be dispatchable at one time.</p></li></ul><h3 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-TerminalHandling(TH)">Terminal Handling (TH)</h3><p>If not stated otherwise new features are generally available in all basic service cut levels (TH-SCN, TH-CSC, TH-PCS) but accessibility or utility may vary with the limitations of the service cut and your individual usage of cadis. In some cases, availability of information and/or functions in a feature may depend on service cut and other licensed options.</p><h4 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-RemoveExpectedStoragePositionviaGUI">Remove Expected Storage Position via GUI</h4><p><em>License requirement: TH-PCS or TH-LDS</em></p><p>An “Expected Storage Location” that has been assigned via the GUI (cadisCONTROL) can now be removed. The expected location will revert to the value set via the data interface or the rule engine (if any).</p><h4 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-ConfigurationofLoadingMeterRecording(cadisAPPWorkflow)">Configuration of Loading Meter Recording (cadisAPP Workflow)</h4><p>The dialog to record loading meters can now be configured to allow the entry of “Free Loading Meters,” “Used Loading Meters,” and “Loading Unit Full” in all variations.</p><h4 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-NotableMinorChangesandBugfixes">Notable Minor Changes and Bugfixes</h4><ul><li><p>Temperature monitoring will now be stopped when unloading a package without defining an actual storage position.</p></li><li><p>The minimum number of seals required before closing a loading can now be configured. This setting applies to cadisCONTROL and cadisSTUDIO. The default is 1 for line haul and 0 for local traffic, to maintain previous behavior.</p></li></ul><h3 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-YardManager(YM)">Yard Manager (YM)</h3><p>If not stated otherwise new features are generally available in all basic service cut levels (YM-CHK, YM-LCH, YM-PLC) but accessibility or utility may vary with the limitations of the service cut and your individual usage of cadis. In some cases, availability of information and/or functions in a feature may depend on service cut and other licensed options.</p><p>— no changes —</p><h3 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-cadisCONNECT">cadisCONNECT</h3><p>cadisCONNECT provides an API layer for programmatic access to cadis functionality.</p><p>Depending on the use case, APIs may be designed to</p><p>integration use cases: retrieve detailed information about specific business objects (e.g., the ETA for the delivery of a certain shipment) or perform actions in cadis (e.g., post a note to a shipment)</p><p>Mass data load: perform cyclic data retrieval for use in business intelligence solutions.</p><p>The API documentation in Swagger format can be downloaded via cadisCONNECT API in OAS3 (Swagger) format from here: <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.cadis.cloud/en/cadis-online-help/developer-resources/cadisconnect-apis/" rel="nofollow"><u>cadisCONNECT APIs </u></a>If you are interested in cadisCONNECT please contact your project-, service- or account-manager for login data and a brief introduction by one of our consultants.</p><p>The API documentation for your current cadis release version is also directly available on you own cadis domain under the same path (<a class="external-link" href="https://cadis-rest-public-doc/" rel="nofollow"><u>https:///cadis-rest-public-doc/</u></a>). Please sign into cadisSTUDIO first to authenticate before accessing the documentation URL.

Please check the sections on “cadisCONNECT” for updates to the cadis APIs</p><h3 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-HostIdinitem:PackageIdentification">HostId in item:PackageIdentification</h3><p>The “HostId” in <code>item:PackageIdentification</code> is now optional for ctItem 2.0 imports. With this change, it is now recommended not to include the HostId for packages unless you need it and are set up to handle packages as individual business objects.<br/><em>Background:</em> Unintended “swapping” of HostIds has a tendency to cause integration problems. Such “swapping” usually occurs due to the HostId being generated inconsistently by a data mapping. If you need to set a package HostId but don’t have a unique technical identifier available in your source data, using the “DefaultBarcode” is the recommended best practice. (Do not use a loop counter.)</p><h3 id="R4.21ReleaseNotes-ExportofLoadingEquipmentAmountincTLoading/Unloading/InventoryStatus">Export of Loading Equipment Amount in cTLoading/Unloading/Inventory Status</h3><p>The business logic behind the export of actual (recorded) loading equipment amounts during unloading, loading, and inventory, in cases where no entry was made by a user on cadisAPP, can now be controlled via configuration.<br/>We introduce a new configuration: <code>disableExportOfZeroOrEmptyLoadingEquipment</code>. If set to “true,” cadis will not export an amount for a loading equipment exchange if no loading equipment of this type was recorded in the loading/unloading/inventory process.<br/>The default setting is “false” (current behavior). In this setting, if a shipment carries an expected amount of exchangeable loading equipment and the user does not record an amount during the handling process, the loading equipment type is exported with an actual amount of “0” in the corresponding status message.</p><p />

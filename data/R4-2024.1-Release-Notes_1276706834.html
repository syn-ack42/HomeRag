In some cases, availability of information and/or functions in a feature may depend on service cut and other licensed options.</p><h3 id="R42024.1ReleaseNotes-NewVersioningNumbersandReleaseCycle">New Versioning Numbers and Release Cycle</h3><p>With this release we have change our versioning scheme and our release cycle.</p><p>We will now publish a new cadis release every 9 weeks. More frequent releases mean more agile development, shorter delivery times and a smoother upgrade experience as upgrade steps are kept smaller.</p><p>Along with this new procedure we have changed the way we label our cadis R4 releases. Each release will consist of the year it was published and a counter of the release in the year. Even though it’s already late in the year “2024.1” is the first release in 2024 under the new naming scheme (our most recent previous release was R4.21)</p><p>In your cadis installation version information, you will find a third number after the release name e.g. “2024.1.1”. The last digit indicates a maintenance build of that particular release.</p><h3 id="R42024.1ReleaseNotes-CreatingpartialshipmentsforpackagesinamasterpalletviacadisAPP">Creating partial shipments for packages in a master pallet via cadisAPP</h3><p><em>License requirement: LPP-MPL</em></p><p>This feature is an extension of the functionality to create partial shipments via the cadisAPP.</p><p><a href="https://cadissoftware.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/kb/pages/1276805139/Create+partial+shipment+via+cadisAPP?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiYTFkYjg5YjYyNDQ4NDkzOTg0YTk0ODY3N2U2NDdlNDIiLCJwIjoiYyJ9" rel="nofollow"><u>Create partial shipment via cadisAPP</u></a></p><p>This functionality allows workers on the terminal to conveniently create “partial shipments” for packages that were left behind on a cross-dock. When such a package is scanned with cadisAPP the user is asked if they want to create a partial shipment. Up to now this was inconvenient for packages already contained in master pallets (MP) as they are not individually scanned. Users would have to open the MP and scan individual packages to create a partial shipment.</p><p>With this release cadisAPP users only needs to scan the MP barcode. They are then asked whether they want to create partial shipments for the MP content where needed.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-left-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource image-left" width="200" src="https://docs.cadis.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-9.png" data-image-src="https://docs.cadis.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-9.png" loading="lazy"></span><h3 id="R42024.1ReleaseNotes-ProductinformationandReleaseNotesnowavailabletoallcadisusersviatheonlinehelp">Product information and Release Notes now available to all cadis users via the online help</h3><p>We have reconfigured our online help to allow all signed in cadis users access to the “Product Information” section, which includes these release notes.</p><p>As long as you have a valid login to a cadis installation (&gt;= R4.18) you can conveniently access this website by using the “Help” link or pressing “F1” in either cadisCONTROL or cadisSTUDIO.  See <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.cadis.cloud/en/2024/04/18/how-to-access-online-help-and-release-notes/" rel="nofollow"><u>How to Access Online Help and Release Notes</u></a> for details.</p><h3 id="R42024.1ReleaseNotes-OtherImprovementsandBugfixes">Other Improvements and Bugfixes</h3><ul><li><p>Fixed the issue where some browser opened up the password auto-fill dialogue inappropriate locations (such as the “Authentication type” menu in the mobile access screen)</p></li><li><p>Fixed an issue in the Koovea temperature control integration where delayed data was not considered for the temperature curve</p></li><li><p>Improved flexibility in storing perspectives for cadisSTUDIO tables. Different aspects of the views can now be stored separately: Columns (column order, width, group-by, sort), Filters and Charts. For each of these three, users can store multiple named views. Users are free to combine these stored settings freely (e.g. switch through different filters while leaving the displayed common set.)Also the generic table display settings (row height, visibility of the status bar, column-control menu) are not part of the stored view anymore but will always return to the last state selected.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource image-center" width="100" src="https://docs.cadis.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-09-23-14_00_52-cadisSTUDIO-150x150.png" data-image-src="https://docs.cadis.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-09-23-14_00_52-cadisSTUDIO-150x150.png" loading="lazy"></span><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" alt="image-20250509-142826.png" width="100" loading="lazy" src="attachments/1276706834/1276543000.png?width=100" data-image-src="attachments/1276706834/1276543000.png" data-height="150" data-width="150" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="1276543000" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20250509-142826.png" data-base-url="https://cadissoftware.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="1276706834" data-linked-resource-container-version="2" data-media-id="318d5fc2-5b76-4be9-b9fa-20504516b21c" data-media-type="file"></span></li><li><p>Info Scan: The feature has been moved to the main menu of cadisSTUDIO.</p></li><li><p>The scanner is now active during cadisAPP login in “Mobile Device” and “Driver” mobile access mode. That way a vehicle or device ID can be scanned instead of manual entry.</p></li><li><p>To increase robustness, barcodes with leading or trailing whitespace are now trimmed before using them. Consequently, barcodes may not intentionally contain leading or trailing blanks, tabulators, or line feeds.

The default is 3 meters (which was the previous hard-coded setting).</p><p>Background: when shipment data is imported, cadis tries to match the relevant addresses (delivery address for deliveries, collection address for collections) to existing stop location master data records in order to amend the shipment data. A Stop Location is matched if either:</p><ul><li><p>the Address-ID is given and references a stop location master data record</p></li><li><p>no Address-ID is given and the “Name1” of the addresses matches either the “Name1” of the Stop location address or one of the Alternative Names of the stop location record AND the geo-location of the Stop Location is within the matching radius of geo-location of the shipment address</p></li></ul><h3 id="R42024.1ReleaseNotes-OtherImprovementsandBugfixes.1">Other Improvements and Bugfixes</h3><ul><li><p>The summation of the “Utilization” columns at the bottom of the trip table in the cadisCONTROL Trip monitor has been removed as it did not make sense and could even be misleading. (Background: The “Utilization” of each individual trip is calculated and displayed as the maximum of weight and pallet place utilization. Making a sum of those lines means adding different measuring units to each other.)</p></li><li><p>Fixed an issue where sequence-optimizing a trip more than 3 days in the future using PTV 2 failed with an error message.</p></li><li><p>Fixed an issue where status/sub-status configured as “not selectable by user” could still be selected on the cadisAPP</p></li><li><p>Collection template creation: when creating a collection template using a “Stop Location” for the shipper address, the suggested collection days in the schedule are now pre-set from the stop location master data record, i.e. days where the location is marked as “Closed” are now pre-set to “deactivated” for generation of collection orders. (Note: this is only applied when creating a new collection template. Once a template has been created changing the stop location maser data does not affect the template.)</p></li><li><p>Added a column “Consignee – Street 2” in Shipments overview, Trips (Tabs “Stops”, “To be dispatched”), Loading details (Tabs “Shipment”, “Stops”)</p></li><li><p>Add shipment via myTrips on the cadisAPP: The function now only provides actually dispatchable shipments (previously all shipments found using the search reference were displayed although usually only one of them could actually be dispatched).</p></li><li><p>Sequence optimization: in the new cadisSTUDIO dialogue, the handling time per stop is now editable and the final few columns that were available in the cadisCONTROL but not yet in cadisSTUDIO have been added.</p></li><li><p>Dangerous goods document: if the trip has more than 1000 dangerous goods points, the “The vehicle must be labelled” section and the “ADR certificate and identification…” sections are automatically checked.</p></li><li><p>Proof of delivery report (ePOD): the Global Tracking Number can now be printed in the pdf (can be controlled via configuration, default is “off”).</p></li><li><p>Proof of delivery report (ePOD): The GEO-Coordinates can now be printed in the pdf (can be controlled via configuration, default is “off”).</p></li></ul><h2 id="R42024.1ReleaseNotes-TerminalHandling(TH)">Terminal Handling (TH)</h2><p>If not stated otherwise, new features are generally available in all basic service cut levels (TH-SCN, TH-CSC, TH-PCS) but accessibility or utility may vary with the limitations of the service cut and your individual usage of cadis.

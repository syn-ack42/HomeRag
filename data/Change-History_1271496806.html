                    <h1 id="ChangeHistory-Introductiontocadis“ChangeHistory”">Introduction to cadis “Change History”</h1><p>We believe that you can never have too much information about the software you use to run your business. On these pages you find an always-updated online listing of all changes in cadis via our online help pages, starting with R4.19. This is in addition to our regular <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.cadis.cloud/en/cadis-online-help/product-information/release-notes/" rel="nofollow"><u>Release Notes</u></a> letter.</p><p>“All changes” truly means everything—from the latest and greatest feature to the most minor bug-fix. Due to the length and constant updates, this list is only available in English.</p><p>Each cadis release change history has two main segments:</p><ol start="1"><li><p><strong>Main Release Segment:</strong> Titled with the release identifier (e.g., “R4.21”). This section contains all changes developed in that release, split into “New and Changed Functions” and “Bugfixes.” This section is not updated post-release, except for documentation errors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Maintenance Segment:</strong> This section includes a chapter for each maintenance release of the main release (e.g., “R4.21-LTS-1”). Whenever a new maintenance version is available, all changes in that version are documented here.</p></li></ol><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource image-center" alt="Change History" width="1800" src="https://docs.cadis.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ChangeHistory.png" data-image-src="https://docs.cadis.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ChangeHistory.png" loading="lazy"></span><p>Each software change includes the following information:</p><ol start="1"><li><p><strong>A unique number (e.g., “[RD-809]”):</strong> If you reported a bug or requested a feature, you might have been given this number as our internal reference. It is also useful if you have any questions.</p></li><li><p><strong>A topic identifier:</strong> This labels the change with a general group of topics, providing context.</p></li><li><p><strong>A list of older cadis versions where this change has been merged:</strong> For example, “RD-1015” has been included in older releases, starting with “R4.19 LTS-8” and “R4.20 LTS.1” in their respective release trains. This change is also listed in the “Maintenance” section of those releases.</p></li></ol><p>Please note that the change history typically does not include information on required licenses. It also includes features that are still in alpha or beta stages. Thus, you might find references to features that you haven’t seen in cadis—they may not be included in your license or might be released only to selected alpha or beta testers.</p>

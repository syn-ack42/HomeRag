                    <p>This video gives a driver’s-eye view of the loading process in the cadisAPP, showing how to quickly access loading lists, scan packages, report damages, and document loading aids with ease. With built-in tools for approval and real-time updates, it ensures smooth, efficient loading so drivers can hit the road with confidence.</p><a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="embed" data-layout="center" data-original-height="480.00" data-original-width="853.34" data-width="100.00" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s3nePsMK-M" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s3nePsMK-M</a><h1 id="Video:HowloadingworksinthecadisAPP-Transcript">Transcript</h1><p>Welcome! Today, you’re stepping into the driver’s shoes to see how loading works right in the cadisAPP. Good news, it’s easier than parallel parking.</p><p>First up, when you open the app, you’ll see your dashboard with different icons for different processes. Your list of loads you will find in “loading” dashboard. If you press the search button, you will find all loading lists assigned to your vehicle, ready and waiting for you. Or just scan one of the packages, the app will automatically pull up the loading list where that shipment is assigned. No hassle, no hunting, the app’s got it covered. These lists come straight from dispatch, no wild surprises, just the stuff you gotta get on your truck today. You can start loading right away, scanning each package with your handheld scanner or by tapping in the app. Your choice, as long as the packages go in the right place! </p><p>If you find damaged goods during loading, you can easily report the damage right in the app, including photos, so everyone stays in the loop without the drama. </p><p>You don’t have to select the deviation type from the list of deviation status options. Instead, just scan a function barcode for “Damaged” or whatever status you need. Status selected, no tapping around. Not sure where to get these barcodes? Ask your dispatcher. Everything you need to know is also in the online help. </p><p>Same trick works when you’re documenting loading aids like pallets or containers. You can enter the number of actual loading equipment manually or just scan the barcode for the type of aid you're using. If you've got, say, two Euro pallets for a shipment, you don’t have to enter the number anywhere. Just scan the function barcode twice, once for each pallet. Three pallets? Three scans and you’re done. </p><p>Speaking of places: If you’ve got loading aids for using to secure the loading, you can document those right in the app under the “Loading equipment details” on transport level. No need to shout across the warehouse, the app has your back. </p><p>Once you’ve scanned and loaded everything, open the menu and choose ‘Submit for approval’. If the OK button stays greyed out, don’t worry! That just means the app needs a bit more info before you can wrap things up. Look out for the blue fields, those are required. Just tap them and fill in the details.</p><p>For example: “How many loading meters are still available?”. The app might ask that. Pop in the number and now, the real highlight: take a picture of the truck’s cargo area. This photo gets saved automatically in cadisCONTROL, and if anyone asks “Did you really load it all?”, you’ve got proof, no sweat. And boom, the OK button lights up, and you’re good to go. </p><p>The dispatcher gets notified and can either approve or, if something’s off, ask you to double-check. So don’t worry, you’re not flying solo. </p><p>And guess what? Once loading is done and approved, you get your stop list on your device and it’s time to hit the road. No detours, just smooth deliveries ahead.</p><p>Ready to load up and roll out? </p><p>Thanks for watching!</p><p>If moving goods is what you do, cadis software makes it smooth for you.</p>

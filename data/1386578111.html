                    <p>When importing shipment data, cadis automatically attempts to enter the geocoordinates of the pick-up or delivery address (depending on whether the shipment is to be picked up or delivered at the respective depot).</p><p>Sometimes, however, automatic geocoding fails and must be performed manually via the user interface. In very rare cases, automatic geocoding can also be incorrect and refer to an incorrect location. This depends on the software settings – and as a rule of thumb, if you set cadis to automatically geocode as many consignments as possible, you increase the probability of incorrect results – and vice versa. The better the address quality, the more successful the geocoding will ultimately be.</p><p>In order to better understand the setting options in cadis, it is necessary to briefly explain the background to geocoding. The GIS server (geo-information system, usually PTV) almost always returns a list of possible geocoding results in response to an address query. These results are each accompanied by metrics on how &quot;good&quot; the respective potential result is. Which result and whether one of the results is accepted at all is controlled by a configuration in cadis.</p><p>The GIS provides information on the &quot;detail quality&quot; of the geocoding and information on the &quot;matching quality&quot; (somewhat simplified).</p><p>The detail quality indicates the level of detail of the map data for the address. &quot;House number&quot; means, for example: &quot;I know the exact house number&quot;, &quot;Postal code&quot; would mean: &quot;I only know the center of the postcode area&quot;.</p><p>&quot;House number interpolated&quot; is the default setting for acceptable results and means: &quot;the GIS does not know the exact house number, but only two-house numbers between which it lies&quot;. e.g.: You are looking for house number 22, but only the exact position of house numbers &quot;20&quot; and &quot;30&quot; is known in the map series. The returned position is then &quot;interpolated&quot; at 1/5 of the distance from 20 to 30 (1/5 because of the side of the street).</p><p>In this standard setting, cadis would only accept addresses that are at least accurate to &quot;interpolated house number&quot; in the case of automatic geocoding in the background.</p><p>The second quality information on &quot;matching quality&quot; means how &quot;sure&quot; the GIS is that it has retrieved the correct address from the map data. For example, there are always different spellings, or it may be that the place name or postcode is missing in the query. Such uncertainties have a negative effect on the &quot;Matching Quality&quot;.</p><p>In cadis, &quot;at least HIGH&quot; (PTV 1) or &quot;at least 85% for each city, street and postal code&quot; (PTV 2, here these components are considered individually and can be configured individually) is the default setting. Depending on the region and the quality of the address data in the shipments, adjustments can be made here to achieve a good compromise between the need for manual geocoding and the risk of incorrect automatic geocoding.</p><p>For the geocoding result to be accepted by cadis, both values must fulfil the minimum criteria. For automatic geocoding, we select restrictive basic settings as standard because inaccurate geopositions and incorrectly selected locations are generally useless for our use cases in cadis.</p><hr/><p>This page is also available in other languages: <a data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://cadissoftware.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/kb/pages/1390575619/Warum+sind+manche+Adressen+nicht+automatisch+geokodiert?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiODM3MzY0OTY4ODAzNGMyOGE0N2MxOGM0YzBiNTA1NzkiLCJwIjoiYyJ9" rel="nofollow">https://cadissoftware.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/kb/pages/1390575619/Warum+sind+manche+Adressen+nicht+automatisch+geokodiert?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiODM3MzY0OTY4ODAzNGMyOGE0N2MxOGM0YzBiNTA1NzkiLCJwIjoiYyJ9</a></p>

                    <p>This cadisAPP tutorial walks drivers through the full process of executing a delivery tour — from trip takeover and stop sequencing to handling deliveries, documenting exceptions, and wrapping up the day. It highlights key features like address validation, digital signatures, returnable tracking, real-time issue reporting, and spontaneous pickup management, all designed to ensure a smooth and traceable delivery experience.</p><a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="embed" data-layout="center" data-original-height="480.00" data-original-width="853.34" data-width="100.00" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EoRx2nb-10" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EoRx2nb-10</a><h1 id="Video:HowtoexecuteyourtripinthecadisAPP-Transcript">Transcript</h1><p>Welcome to this tutorial about executing your trip in the cadisAPP. </p><p>This video picks up right after the dispatcher has approved the loading completion in cadisCONTROL. Now it’s time for the driver to hit the road.</p><p>As soon as the dispatcher gives the green light, you’ll receive push notification about your trip and the new order is sent to your app. </p><p>Depending on your company’s configuration, you may need to register for the trip or take over it in the app. If that’s the case, make sure to do both. No trip without a proper handshake!</p><p>You’ll now see the stop list with all orders assigned to your trip. By default, you can still change the stop sequence directly in the app: Use the action menu and tap “Change Sequence.” Then just drag and drop stops with your finger to adjust the order.</p><p>Keep in mind: the stop list reflects the reverse loading sequence. That means the first stops were loaded last and are likely at the very back of the vehicle. So before you shuffle things around – think like a Tetris master.</p><p>A stop can be started by simply scanning a package.</p><p>cadis checks your current GPS location and the address of the order to help avoid delivery mix-ups. If everything matches, you’re good to go.</p><p>Once all packages for a stop are handled, tap the “Next” button. If loading equipment exchange is configured in your system, you’ll see the loading equipment dialog: If the number of returned and handed-over items differs, simply enter the actual values. Otherwise, just tap “1:1 Exchange” for a quick match. Easy, fair, and traceable.</p><p>Last step: collect the customer’s signature. The default option is electronic signature. Finish the stop by pressing the close button. If needed, you can choose alternative order closure types via the action menu: </p><ul><li><p>Photo of the receipt: the camera app opens automatically. </p></li><li><p>Signature on receipt: the electronic signature becomes inactive, and you collect a signature the old-school way, on the physical paperwork (just don’t lose that document, okay?).</p></li></ul><p>If the customer has given a drop-off permission, simply select the status “deposit as agreed” on order level after handling the packages. You’ll then be prompted to take a photo of the drop-off spot as proof – because nothing says “safe delivery” like a picture of a doorstep with your box on it. </p><p>If a package is damaged, you can document it with a photo. </p><p>If you run into a delivery issue, no problem, cadis has options: Maybe a single package is missing. You can mark it as such at the package level. If the entire order can’t be delivered, mark the order as “Not delivered” and choose the appropriate reason from the list. You can even try again later during the same trip – because second chances are a thing in cadisAPP.</p><p>Pickup stops are usually listed at the end of your stop list. Processing them is pretty much the same as deliveries.</p><p>In many cases, the package to pickup isn’t known in advance.</p><p>When you tap “Process Stop,” cadis assumes the pickup will succeed and automatically sets the status to “Collected.” But if it doesn’t happen, no worries. Use the action menu to set a pickup issue and select the appropriate reason.</p><p>If there’s a barcode, you can scan the packages you’re collecting.</p><p>Sometimes, new pickup orders pop up while you’re already on tour. </p><p>You’ll get a notification in the app. Check it and confirm if the order makes sense for your trip.</p><p>Drivers can also reject pickup orders. To do this, just open the order list and tap on the details without confirming the stop. You’ll see a little thumbs-down button. But rejecting it isn’t the end of the story:</p><p>You’ll need to provide a reason right after. No ghosting allowed.</p><p><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="2a5a9927-04d1-40a5-80d7-fbd160b31720">Once all deliveries and pickups are completed and you’re back at the depot, you can complete the trip directly in the app.</span></p><p><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="2a5a9927-04d1-40a5-80d7-fbd160b31720">Pro tip: Log out of cadisAPP at the end of your shift. This automatically triggers the trip completion in cadisCONTROL. But that only works if all orders are fully processed. So double-check before you call it a day.</span></p><p>And that’s it. From first scan to final signature.</p><p>See you in the next tutorial – and hey, don’t forget to charge your device!</p><p>Thanks for watching.</p><p>If moving goods is what you do, cadis software makes it smooth for you.</p>

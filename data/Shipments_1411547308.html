The shipment is then &quot;open&quot; again for a new assignment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Auto Dispatch </strong>— Starts the automatic dispatch (Auto dispatch) for the previously selected shipments. The respective dispatch target has already been determined in advance through the postal code routing and the defined rule set of the auto dispatch.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disqualify shipments </strong>— With this function, a shipment is manually set to the status &quot;shipped out&quot;. In the loading list, the note &quot;Ship out&quot; is entered. The warehouse status is no longer &quot;in warehouse&quot;, and the dispatch status is set to &quot;not dispatchable&quot;.</p></li><li><p><strong>Start Free Route Optimization with Selection </strong>— Starts the free tour optimization for the selected shipments. You will be redirected to the Tour Optimization mask where the optimization parameters can be defined.</p></li><li><p><strong>Loading List / Unloading List / Inventory List </strong>— Opens the respective applicable list – provided the shipment was previously part of such a list. This enables targeted tracking of the shipment within the logistical processes such as loading, unloading, or inventory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Corresponding Trip </strong>— Opens the tour monitor with direct selection of the relevant tour and the associated stop, if the shipment is part of a local transport tour.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shipment Dispatchable </strong>— Sets the shipment to &quot;dispatchable&quot; status. This function is required when a shipment is to be delivered again or newly planned after a delivery obstacle or return. Only dispatchable shipments are considered in the list for manual dispatch or automatic dispatch (Auto dispatch).</p></li><li><p><strong>Create partial Shipment </strong>— Enables the creation of a follow-up shipment (also referred to as a partial shipment) based on the existing shipment. This becomes necessary, for example, when complete delivery was not possible or for partial deliveries due to volume or weight restrictions. The follow-up shipment takes over all relevant data from the original shipment and can be planned and delivered separately.</p></li><li><p><strong>Set PUD Status </strong>— Enables manual setting of the pickup or delivery status (PUD = Pickup and Delivery) of a local transport shipment. This function is used when: the status was not automatically transmitted by the driver in the mobile system or the set status needs to be corrected.</p></li></ul><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><strong>Status for Collection Order:</strong></p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-left-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-left" alt="grafik-20250813-124732.png" width="399" loading="lazy" src="attachments/1411547308/1412562950.png?width=399" data-image-src="attachments/1411547308/1412562950.png" data-height="392" data-width="399" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="1412562950" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="grafik-20250813-124732.png" data-base-url="https://cadissoftware.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="1411547308" data-linked-resource-container-version="7" data-media-id="712ff5d0-e29d-49f6-8f0a-b403e43a8c3f" data-media-type="file"></span><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><strong>Status for Delivery Order:</strong></p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-left-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-left" alt="grafik-20250813-124855.png" width="539" loading="lazy" src="attachments/1411547308/1412792321.png?width=539" data-image-src="attachments/1411547308/1412792321.png" data-height="755" data-width="539" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="1412792321" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="grafik-20250813-124855.png" data-base-url="https://cadissoftware.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="1411547308" data-linked-resource-container-version="7" data-media-id="c01c9549-f61e-4510-8968-74d16c2f8963" data-media-type="file"></span><ul><li><p><strong>Set Processing Status </strong>— Serves to document internal processing steps outside the cadis system – e.g., for inquiries, clarification cases, or delays due to delivery obstacles.

After the change, the shipment no longer appears in the list of dispatchable shipments for the current day and is thus no longer considered by the automatic dispatch (Auto dispatch) for the current day. This is helpful to specifically exclude shipments from daily planning without completely canceling or postponing them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Edit Instructions </strong>— Opens the &quot;Shipment Details&quot; mask with the ability to edit existing note texts (e.g., add or correct), delete, or enter new texts. Note texts serve the communication of special information about the shipment, e.g., delivery notes, special features at the recipient, or internal notes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Change Shipment Group </strong>— With this function, the group assignment of a shipment can be adjusted. The original grouping was automatically made through the rule set for shipment group determination. If regrouping is required (e.g., due to changed priorities, targets, or recipient structure), you can select a new group from a list of existing groups and assign the shipment to it. </p></li></ul><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-left-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-left" alt="grafik-20250813-125241.png" width="401" loading="lazy" src="attachments/1411547308/1412628487.png?width=401" data-image-src="attachments/1411547308/1412628487.png" data-height="168" data-width="401" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="1412628487" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="grafik-20250813-125241.png" data-base-url="https://cadissoftware.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="1411547308" data-linked-resource-container-version="7" data-media-id="fb43693a-8a6f-4f80-ac28-a7768f8d5919" data-media-type="file"></span><ul><li><p><strong>Dispatching/Loading Lock</strong> — Prevents the shipment from being dispatched or loaded by setting a lock.

This function is used when the reason for the lock has been resolved and the shipment should be included in normal operations again.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cancel Collection</strong> — Completely cancels the shipment collection, removing it from all active planning and dispatch processes.

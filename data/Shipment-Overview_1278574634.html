The overview is updated automatically every 30 seconds, but can also be updated manually using the :refresh: symbol.</p><h1 id="ShipmentOverview-Filterarea">Filter area</h1><p>To display as many shipments as possible, you can hide the filter area and reveal it using the :FilterDown: symbol.</p><p>You can filter the shipments according to different criteria. Different filter sets are implemented for different applications, which you select using the <em>Filter</em> list box.</p><p>Each filter set contains different fields that can be used for filtering. One or more fields are used as the main filter criteria. These must always be specified; the fields are marked with a yellow background as mandatory fields.</p><p>Most filter options are self-explanatory. Here are some specific cases:</p><ul><li><p>“Today” in the filter set means that the execution date is preset to today’s date. But you can change this as you like.</p></li><li><p>Failed shipment import: If shipments are imported from a leading system, updates can be rejected by <em>cadis</em> if the shipment has already been processed in <em>cadis</em>, for example. This is shown on the shipment as an event requiring confirmation and can be acknowledged using the context menu (see below). This filter is used to filter corresponding shipments.</p></li><li><p>Hide main shipments: If a shipment is not delivered completely, the remaining shipment will be delivered using a subsequent delivery shipment. This filter ensures that in such cases, only the subsequent delivery shipment is filtered, but not the main shipment.</p></li><li><p>Filter according to shipment characteristics: it is possible to filter for many shipment characteristics: <br/>:reglerMitteGrau: The characteristic is not considered during the filter process <br/>:reglerObenGruen: Shipments that have this characteristic are filtered<br/>:reglerUntenRot: Shipments that do not have this characteristic are filtered</p></li><li><p>Multiple selection<br/>For some filters whose filter values are selected from selection lists, multiple selections are also possible:<br/>E.g.

In unclear cases, you can display the description of the column as a tooltip by hovering the mouse over the column header. In many cases, if the field content is unclear, you can use the tooltip to obtain further details.</p><h1 id="ShipmentOverview-Contextmenu">Context menu</h1><p>Using the context menu (press the right mouse button on the table) you can perform different actions on the selected shipments. Actions that are shown in grey cannot be selected for the selected shipments.

For multiple selected shipments, you can scroll through the selected shipments in the <em>Shipment Details</em> screen.</p><h2 id="ShipmentOverview-ArrivalNotification">Arrival Notification</h2><p>Only available for last mile shipments / collections, which have the corresponding attribute. The notification is triggerd (if configured), at least documented.</p><h2 id="ShipmentOverview-FreightForwarder">Freight Forwarder</h2><p>Offers the possibility to assign a freight forwarder / Master dispatcher to the shipment or to remove the assignment.</p><h2 id="ShipmentOverview-Autodispatching">Auto dispatching</h2><p>This triggers the Auto dispatching function for the selected shipments, whereby the dispatching destination has already been defined using postal code routing and the automatic dispatching rules engine.</p><h2 id="ShipmentOverview-Bordereausupplement">Bordereau supplement</h2><p>Herewith the shipment is manually set to <em>outgoing</em>, the loading list is set to outgoing, the terminal status is <em>not on terminal</em> and the dispatching status is <em>not available</em>.</p><h2 id="ShipmentOverview-Startfreerouteoptimizationwithselection">Start free route optimization with selection</h2><p>Starts the route optimization for the selected shipments.

If you want to deliver a shipment again after a delivery issue, for example, you must set it to “dispatchable” so that it is shown in the list of “dispatchable” (available) shipments and can be scheduled manually or using the automatic dispatching function.</p><h2 id="ShipmentOverview-Createpartialshipment">Create partial shipment</h2><p>A partial shipment is created for the shipment.</p><h2 id="ShipmentOverview-SetPUDStatus">Set PUD Status</h2><p>Sets the collection or delivery status of a secondary distribution shipment if it was not set by the driver of the secondary distribution vehicle or if you want to correct the status assigned by the driver.</p><h2 id="ShipmentOverview-Setprocessingstatus">Set processing status</h2><p>You can set a processing status to record processing steps that take place outside <em>cadis</em>, for example, clarification processes in the case of delivery issues.</p><p>You can enter a status and explanatory text in this screen:</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-left-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource image-left" width="400" src="https://docs.cadis.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Pasted-48.png" data-image-src="https://docs.cadis.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Pasted-48.png" loading="lazy"></span><p>The current processing status is displayed in the list of shipments in the Processing status shipment column, as a tooltip completed with text and name of the user who entered the status.</p><h2 id="ShipmentOverview-Changeexecutiondate">Change execution date</h2><p>If you want to deliver or collect a shipment on a later day, you can change the execution date. The shipment will then no longer appear in the “dispatchable” shipments for the current day and will therefore not be taken into account by the automatic dispatching function for the current day.</p><h2 id="ShipmentOverview-Editinstructions">Edit instructions</h2><p>The Shipment details screen is opened with the option of changing or deleting information text or entering new information text</p><h2 id="ShipmentOverview-Changeshipmentgroup">Change shipment group</h2><p>You can use this function to change the group assignment of the shipment that was made using the <em>Shipment group</em> rules engine and assign the shipment to another group.<br/>To do this, you select one from the list of existing groups:</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-left-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource image-left" width="400" src="https://docs.cadis.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Pasted-49.png" data-image-src="https://docs.cadis.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Pasted-49.png" loading="lazy"></span><h2 id="ShipmentOverview-Dispatching/Loadinglock,Removedispatching/loadinglock">Dispatching / Loading lock, Remove dispatching / loading lock</h2><p>You use this function to manually set a loading lock or remove a loading lock that was set in cadis.

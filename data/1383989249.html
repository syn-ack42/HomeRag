In this video, we’ll show you how to set up your first depot in cadis. This is the foundation you need before you can start working with the system.</p><p>To get started, open the Master data dashboard. Then go to the Org tree section. This is where you create your organizational structure – your depots, regions, or corporate levels.</p><p>You’ll notice a predefined depot called Depot1. This is required for your initial login. Without a depot, you can’t even access cadis. But Depot1 is just a starting point.</p><p>Once you're in, take it as a template and create your own depot based on your company’s actual setup. To create a depot, klick the “Create” button. We only need to fill in a few essential fields.</p><p>In the General Information section on the left, make sure to:</p><ul><li><p>Select the type as Depot.</p></li><li><p>Choose the parent unit that this depot belongs to. For example, your company’s corporate unit. But you can also choose the predefined “SaaS” entry.</p></li><li><p>Set the default report locale, which defines the default language for reports related to this unit. For example, de for German.</p></li></ul><p>In the Branch Details section, we enter the following:</p><ul><li><p>The name of the depot or branch.</p></li><li><p>The time zone, so the system knows which time applies to loading, unloading, and tour planning.</p></li></ul><p>Optionally, you can assign a logo for this branch.</p><p>Also, define the working days, for example, Monday through Friday. These days indicate when tours can start or end at this depot.</p><p>Make sure that the cadis checkbox is selected. This activates the unit for use in cadis.</p><p>Next, let’s move to the Branch Address. This part is especially important because it helps ensure correct routing and geocoding.</p><p>Enter the street, postal code, and city. We also strongly recommend filling in the latitude and longitude manually. Sometimes, external routing services like the PTV server might not recognize the full address correctly. Providing exact coordinates ensures accurate navigation.</p><p>The other sections like Branch Contact, Company Address, and PO Box can remain empty for now unless you want to add specific information for documentation purposes.</p><p>The display order is optional as well. But if you want to sort units in dropdown menus, you can assign a number here. A lower number means a higher position in the list.</p><p>Once all required fields are filled in, you can save the org unit. And it’s ready to be used in cadisCONTROL and the cadisAPP.</p><p>That’s it! You’ve successfully created your new depot.</p><p>Thanks for watching.</p><p>If moving goods is what you do, cadis software makes it smooth for you.</p>
